# Metaverse Standards Forum | Accessibility in the Metaverse Working Group

[Accessibility in the Metaverse Landing Page](https://metaverse-standards.org/domain-groups/accessibility-in-the-metaverse/)

## Who We Are

**We are a working group of the Metaverse Standards Forum dedicated to securing accessibility and inclusion for everyone in the metaverse.**

Our goal is to generate insights, identify risks, and recommend strategies and best practices to ensure that immersive experiences, environments, interfaces, and interactions are accessible to all, regardless of abilities or disabilities and access needs.

Ultimately, we will support the creation of comprehensive XR standards on par with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/). This will enable organizations to know with certainty whether their XR applications are accessible or not, and open the door to the next phase of ethical growth of the metaverse.

## Why Join?

Making the metaverse accessible is a group effort. We need representatives from across tech, academia, advocacy and more to solve it – including you!  

**We generally meet every other Tuesday at 8am PT / 11am ET / 3pm UTC via Zoom**.  Members can access our MSF Portal, participate in meetings, contribute to working documents, and more.  

Joining does not come with any formal responsibilities – if you just want to receive email updates or listen in on the meetings, that’s fine. However, we hope that you will help us conduct research, reach out to stakeholders, and do your part to make the metaverse a more inclusive place!  If you’d like a one-time invite to see if the group is right for you, email us at [accessibility-chair@lists.metaverse-standards.org](mailto:accessibility-chair@lists.metaverse-standards.org).
